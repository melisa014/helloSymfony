Installation
============

Step 1: Download the Bundle
---------------------------

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
$ composer require <package-name> "~1"
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

Step 2: Enable the Bundle
-------------------------

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new <vendor>\<bundle-name>\<bundle-long-name>(),
        );

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Step 3: Manage routing
----------------------

The easiest way to enable routing of bundle to your application is using annotations.
Add this code in `config/routing.yml` file of your project:
	
```php
iff_chat:
    resource: "@IFFChatBundle/Controller/"
    type: annotation
```
Use Symfony annotations to choose routes of actions:

```php	
/**
 * @Route("/chat")
 */
class ChatController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @Route("/")
     * 
     * @return Response
     */
    public function indexAction(): Response
    { ... }
```
